## About ML Zoomcamp

This is a practical course where you'll learn to build and deploy machine learning systems. We focus on the engineering side from training models to getting them to work in production.

**Content to learn**
- Core ML algorithms and when to use them
- Scikit-Learn and XGBoost
- Preparing data, feature engineering
- Model evaluation and selection
- Deploying models with FastAPI, uv, Docker, and cloud platforms
- Using Kubernetes for ML model serving
- Deep learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow

**Technical setup**: For machine learning modules, you only need a laptop with an internet connection. For deep learning sections, we'll use cloud resources for more intensive computations.

## Prerequisites

**You'll need:**
- Prior programming experience (at least 1+ year)
- Comfort with command line basics

You don't need any prior experience with machine learning. We'll start from the basics.
