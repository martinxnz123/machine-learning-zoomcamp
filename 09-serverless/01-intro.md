## 9.1 Introduction to Serverless

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLIVwIsU6RA&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hIhxl5Ji8t4O6lPAOpHaCLR"><img src="images/thumbnail-9-01.jpg"></a>

In the last session, we built and trained a clothes classification deep learning model using `Keras` and `TensorFlow`. This session focuses on deploying it. The model categorizes images of clothing items (e.g., üëï t-shirts, üëñ pants, etc.) uploaded by users on a website. Deployment will be done using **AWS Lambda**, a serverless solution to execute code without managing servers, and instead of `TensorFlow`, we will use `TensorFlow-lite`.

Refer to [updates.md](updates.md) for info on running TF lite
in 2024.
